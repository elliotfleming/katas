# FizzBuzz

Typically the first Katas you will do.  

An old childrens game. Sit in a circle and go around counting...  

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...  

If the number is divisible by 3, say 'fizz'.  
If the number is divisible by 5, say 'buzz'.  
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (15), 'fizzbuzz'.  

1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz,
11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz
